# Packet-Analyzer

- This tool is in a beginner stage.
- More features will be added soon.

As of now it is able to count the number of packets in the given 'pcap' file and also find the number of IPv4 and TCP packets. This is my submission as a second prototype in the Microsoft Cybersecurity Engage 2022.
